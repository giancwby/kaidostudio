GRAAR's name comes from combining the words Graphic & Architecture, which reflects their interdisciplinary approach to their work. This project was a collaboration with GRAAR to design and develop their portfolio, along with <a href="https://kaidostudio.pages.dev/projects/coolnewcrap/" target="_blank">Cool New Crap's website</a>. In exchange, they helped us with making me and my wife's beautiful <a href="https://graar.ph/post/casa-c/" target="_blank">apartment</a>.
