Cool New Crap creates cool, new, furniture made by CNC, a process that uses machines to measure and cut wood. This project, along with <a href="https://kaidostudio.pages.dev/projects/graar/" target="_blank">GRAAR's website</a>, was a collaboration with my friends at GRAAR, an architecture studio, to help design and build me and my wife's <a href="https://graar.ph/post/casa-c/" target="_blank">apartment</a>.
