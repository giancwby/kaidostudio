Cool New Crap creates cool, new, furniture made by CNC, a process that uses machines to measure and cut wood. This project was a collaboration with GRAAR to help design and build my <a href="https://graar.ph/post/casa-c/" target="_blank">apartment</a>, while I made their <a href="https://graar.ph/" target="_blank">website</a>.
